# CPU Scheduler Visualizer 🧠⚙️

This project simulates **Operating System scheduling algorithms** using **C++** and provides a GUI to visualize the process execution using **Python Tkinter**.

## ✨ Features
- FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin algorithms
- Calculates Waiting Time & Turnaround Time
- Displays Gantt Chart (visually via GUI)
- Modular and clean code with file I/O between C++ & Python

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `cpp/`: Contains C++ logic for scheduling
- `gui/`: Python Tkinter GUI to interact with the logic
- `data/`: Intermediate input/output text files
- `assets/`: Optional images or references

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed)
- g++ compiler for C++

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile and run the C++ file:

2. Launch GUI:

## 📊 Sample Output
The GUI will show:
- Scheduling Gantt Chart
- Per-process waiting time
- Average turnaround and waiting times
